# [Portfolio V2](https://seb-graf.com)

This is my improved portfolio with a BLOG [(Live link)](https://seb-graf.com)

The challenge was to add a dynamic blog to my personal webpage. I decided to migrate my code from a simple Create-React-App to a NextJS app.</br> I'm using GraphQL to query data from GraphCMS using both client-side and server-side rendering.</br>
Thanks to this, I now get a fully custom blog section that I can manage through a CMS. The user can also post comments via a graphQl mutation query.
